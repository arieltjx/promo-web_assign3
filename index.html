       <p class="bigspace">Oh, I'm obsessed<br>
         With the way your head is layin' on my chest <br>
         How you love the things I hate about myself<br>
         That no one knows, but with you, I see hope again<br>
         Oh, I'm a mess<br>
         When I overthink the little things in my head<br>
         You seem to always help me catch my breath<br>
         But then I lose it again<br>
         When I look at you, that's the end<br>
         And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes?<br>
         Butterflies can't stop me fallin' for you<br>
         And darlin', this is more than anything I felt before<br>
         You're everything that I want, but I didn't think I'd find<br>
         Someone who is worth the wait of all the years of my heartbreak<br>
         But I know now I found the one I love<br>
         And I love the way<br>
         You can never find the right things to say<br>
         And you can't sit still an hour in the day<br>
         I'm so in love, let's run away because us is enough<br>
         And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes?<br>
         And butterflies can't stop me fallin' for you<br>
         And darlin', this is more than anything I felt before<br>
         You're everything that I want, but I didn't think I'd find<br>
         Someone who is worth the wait of all the years of my heartbreak<br>
         But I know now I found the one<br>
         Come close, let me be home for anything<br>
         Good or bad, I know it's worth it, whoa<br>
         Whoa<br>
         And darlin', this is more than anything I felt before<br>
         You're everything that I want, but I didn't think I'd find<br>
         Someone who is worth the wait of all the years of my heartbreak<br>
         But I know now I found the one I love</p>
